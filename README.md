# CodeAlpha_Car_Price_Prediction
This Car Price Prediction project is focused on predicting the selling price of cars based on several features such as the car brand, model, year of manufacture, fuel type, mileage, and engine size. The project begins by processing a dataset containing various car-related attributes, performing essential steps like handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features to prepare the data for analysis. Afterward, feature engineering is applied to identify key variables that significantly influence car prices. The core of the project involves training machine learning models, including algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to predict car prices. The model's performance is then evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score to measure prediction accuracy. This project provides valuable insights into data preprocessing, feature selection, and regression modeling, using Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. It serves as a great learning experience for predicting prices based on real-world data.
